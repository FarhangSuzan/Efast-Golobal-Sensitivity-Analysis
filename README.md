# Efast-Global-Sensitivity-Analysis
Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test

East sensitivity analysis is a robust method employed to evaluate input variables' influence on a model's output. By systematically varying input parameters and observing the resultant variations in outputs, Efast helps identify which inputs have the most significant impact on model performance. This technique is instrumental in complex models where understanding the relationship between numerous variables and the output can be challenging. East stands out by its ability to handle both linear and non-linear relationships, as well as interactions between input variables, making it a comprehensive tool for sensitivity analysis across various fields, including engineering, economics, and environmental science. By providing insights into model sensitivities, Efast aids in model simplification, parameter prioritization, and robust decision-making, enhancing model reliability and informing targeted research and development efforts.
