# Efast and Sobol-Global-Sensitivity-Analysis
Advanced sensitivity analysis methods

Efast (Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test) and Sobol sensitivity analyses are quantitative methods used to investigate how the uncertainty in the output of a model can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in the model input. Efast employs Fourier transforms to assess the sensitivity of model outputs to multiple inputs simultaneously, making it particularly useful for models with a high degree of parameter interaction. It quantifies the main effect and higher-order interactions of each input parameter on the output. On the other hand, the Sobol method, a variance-based sensitivity analysis technique, decomposes the variance of the model output into fractions that can be attributed to inputs or sets of inputs. This approach provides a more detailed understanding of the contribution of each input parameter to the output variance, including main effects and interaction effects. Both Efast and Sobol analyses are powerful tools for model exploration, helping researchers and analysts identify critical parameters that influence model behaviour, thereby guiding model simplification, parameter tuning, and uncertainty reduction efforts.

Replace your model, including the relevant parameter values and initial conditions, and execute the code. An example result of the eFast sensitivity analysis for the viral load is provided in the attached image.
